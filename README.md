## More freedom, less advertising

William James held that our life experience would amount to whatever we had paid attention to. What does your life amount to if your attention is spent on ads? 

Everyone underestimates the power of advertising in their life. No one is born wanting an Hermes bag or a 4k HDTV. These desires only exist because advertisers create demand for their products.

[PrivacyTube](https://privacytube.github.io/) is a really simple project. I like falling asleep to guided meditations or ambient noise but I'm creeped out by the ads on YouTube. 

I've been using different [proxies](https://invidio.us/) to view YouTube on desktop for awhile now, but didn't have a great solution for viewing videos on my phone.

On desktop, I view Youtube through [invidio.us](https://invidio.us/). 

On Android, use [Newpipe](https://newpipe.net/). 

On iOS, now you can use [PrivacyTube](https://privacytube.github.io/).

The features are dead simple:
- search for videos
- view those videos

If you want to add more features, I would love to see your contributions. It is a really simple project written in vanilla JavaScript so do not feel scared to jump in.
